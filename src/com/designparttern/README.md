## Design Principles
### - Encapsulate what varies
### - Favor composition over inheritance
### - Programming to interfaces not to inplementations
### - Strive for loosely coupled betweeb objects that interact
### - Classes should OPEN for extension and CLOSE for modification
### - Depends on abstraction, not concrete classes
### - Don't call us, we'll call you
### - A class should have only one reason to change
